Test:

After 14 months travelling and Working Holiday in Australia I'm going back to DevOps.

The goal: getting a worlwide remote job with highest salary, or skyrocketing with my own ideas:)

All great discoveries and tricky Linux commands will be immortalized here for later lookup as a tech-notes-blog.
