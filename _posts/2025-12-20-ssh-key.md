Alle Jahre wieder..


For the CentOS VM in OpenShift I had to add a ssh-key.

I didn't have a working one on my machine so back it goes to creating one with my WSL RHEL.

Command: $ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "14peterstadler@gmail.com"

Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
(With optional Passphrase)
Your identification has been saved in /mnt/c/Users/peter/.ssh/id_ed25519
Your public key has been saved in /mnt/c/Users/peter/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

The key fingerprint is: SHA256:XXXXXXX 14peterstadler@gmail.com

The key's randomart image is:

+--[ED25519 256]--+

\|xxxxx       \|

\|    xxxxx   \|

\|       xxxxx\|

+----[SHA256]-----+

$ls .ssh: id_ed25519  id_ed25519.pub
